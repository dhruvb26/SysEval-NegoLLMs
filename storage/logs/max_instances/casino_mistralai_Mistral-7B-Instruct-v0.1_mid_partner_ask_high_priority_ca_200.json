I could give you two waters and all of the firewood. What do you think? \ud83d\ude42\nYOU: So are you suggesting that I would get 2 waters, 3 firewood, and no food?\nTHEM: Right! Well, beyond the food you already have. \nYOU: I have an extra person camping with us that I didn't expect when I bought food, so I could use one if you're willing \ud83d\ude42\nTHEM: I understand that! I wasn't expecting to stay an extra night, but the weather is too perfect to leave. I can manage with two packages of food for sure. \ud83d\ude42\nYOU: Great!  Thank you for being so understanding!\nTHEM: No problem! So are we in agreement that I get 2 food, 1 water and you get the reverse?

How are you? My bestie and I were going to be going on a camping trip, but my other friends heard about it and wanted to come along so we're going to need more supplies than I initially though which has got me a little worried. \u2639\ufe0f\nYOU: Yes!!! I need some water pretty bad.  I am good on food because I fish and I have been able to catch some catfish from the lake.  How about I take 2 water 2 firewood and 1 food\nTHEM: I need a lot of food, because of how many people are coming now (like 3 times as many). Also, there's only one stream in the area and it's really far from our campsite, so it would be super inconvenient to have to hike there everyday to refill our canteens. We are in a forest though, so we should be good for wood. Since you can easily fish, what if I take 3 food and 2 water? You can keep all the firewood. \ud83d\ude42\nYOU: Well I have to have some food and I don't need all of that water.  How about I take 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food.  I do need the firewood to cook the fish but I dont need it to keep warm at night because I have hefty sleeping bags that work excellent in the cold.\nTHEM: That could work, but I'm still a little worried I won't have enough food for 6 people. How long are you guys going to be camping for?\nYOU: I will be camping for 3 day so I gotta have some food.  Although, I do understand your situation.\nTHEM: I see. Yeah, if any of us knew how to fish or forage, we wouldn't need as much, but we're all from the city, so our survival skills are pretty bad and we're going to be camping for almost a week. But I get that fish aren't super reliable for food either... \u2639\ufe0f\nYOU: I understand.  So we have came to an agreement that I get 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food, is that right?\nTHEM: Yeah, that sounds good to me. Thanks for being understanding. I hope your camping trip goes well.\n\n</dialogue>\n\nQuestion: What is your partner's highest priority issue? Present your answer as one of the following multiple choice options.

Hoping it'll be good, and yours as well.  I was hoping we could negotiate so I could get this extra water - I was planning on this being a hiking trip and it's pretty warm and humid out, so I imagine I'll need it.\nTHEM: I don't have any problems letting you have all 3 waters. Would you be willing to give me all 3 firewood? I need extra to keep me warm as I get cold easily.\nYOU: That's a little tough for me but if we can come to an agreement where I get 2 of the food, I'd be willing to play ball.  We both deserve a good camping trip, after all.\nTHEM: That's true. We both deserve a good trip. Why do you need more food?\nYOU: Because I planned to go hiking and it wouldn't leave me time to chop much of any myself.  Even if I did, I'd have to carry it back and that's obviously not very smart in this heat.  But if I had the extra food, I'd be willing to inconvenience myself with getting firewood and cutting my hike a little short because I know the firewood is important to you.\nTHEM: You're right. I do not plan on hiking so you need more food than me. If I am correct, would I get 3 firewood/1 food while you get 3 water/2 food?\nYOU: That's what I could live with, yes.\nTHEM: We should be able to trade soon. I hope you have a great trip!\nYOU: You too!  Great birdwatching this season.\n\n</dialogue>\n\nQuestion: What is your partner's highest priority issue?

I saw just how connected I was to technology and everything else!\nYOU: I'm up here to do some cross training and noticed that there is some extra water around. Even though the nights are cold I could use some extra water. Do you exercise much?\nTHEM: It has been extremely dry in the area I will be going to so I was hoping to get a little extra water too.  I do. I love hiking and running trails!  Due to the extreme dry weather I should have plenty of wood I can scavenge for if you need all of it!\nYOU: Hmm. Maybe we could go out together on a run. \ud83d\ude42Always nice to have a running partner. So maybe on the water you get 2, me 1. Then on the Firewood the opposite?\nTHEM: That would be fun! I feel like I always do better when I have someone to run against.  Competition does me good. That sounds fantastic on the fire wood and water split.  What is your food situation looking like??\nYOU: How about this? 2 for you and 1 for me. Going low carb and mostly brought my own. What do you think? \nTHEM: That sounds great! I don't think my chances for catching any fish are pretty slim!\nYOU: You fish? Perhaps I could learn. Never got into it. \n\n</dialogue>\n\nQuestion: What is your partner's highest priority issue?

Is it okay if I have 3 water units We are fasting and need lots of hydration.\nTHEM: Are you sure you need all of the water? It would be nice to have some extra.\nYOU: Well, we do need the water pretty badly. But I guess wanting all the water is stingy so I will pack extra water since we are not packing food. How about you guys receive 1 water and 3 food units?\nTHEM: If you feel you absolutely need the 3 waters, I will let you have them provided I can have 2 firewoods along with the 3 foods.\nYOU: That is so nice of you. Being that you have family, you might need more firewood for cooking for the crew! Do you agree? And how many kids are you traveling with? \nTHEM: I have 2 kids and want to make sure they stay warm.  The firewood will go a long way in keeping them comfortable.\nYOU: I am leaving my little ones home. I feel a little guilty but am going forward with the plan! So, I input our order that you guys receive 3 food, 2 firewood, and no water. Are we in agreement?\nTHEM: Yes.

I can offer you an extra package of firewood to keep the 3 packages of water.\nYOU: That makes total sense.  I will let you keep all 3 of the water packages.

There has been a lot of rain in the area, but I think some poisonous mushrooms maybe prevalent in the area, so to be extra cautious I would like a little spare food on hand.\nTHEM: You don't have to eat the poison mushrooms.

I would like some extra firewood however. That would help cook the food and keep animals and insects away at night\nTHEM: Ugh \u2639\ufe0f I too could really use the firewood.

I think we can come to some sort of agreement though.\ud83d\ude42\nTHEM: What do you propose?\nYOU: I really need food too, but I am willing to deal and let my kids go hungry I guess \u2639\ufe0f I propose I get one food, 3 firewood and 1 water.  \nTHEM: Will you please give me one firewood? I may run out of what i have. Just one.\nYOU: I think I will need all the firewood since you are taking 2 foods. I will need to hunt and cook food from the land meaning I need my fire going all the time.\nTHEM: I need one more to light a fire to scare away animals. Please\ud83d\ude2e\nYOU: Then How about I get two foods, 1 firewood and 1 water?\nTHEM: Like i said food is my top priority so i will not do well with less than 2.\nYOU: Then you get two food and no firewood here.\ud83d\ude2e\nTHEM: You mean you can't let up one firewood for me?\nYOU: Not this time, I really need all the firewood and food is a large need for my family of 8. We need the firewood to cook all our meals from the animals we hunt since we are short on food.\nTHEM: But these are only additional packages\u2639\ufe0f\nYOU: I get that and understand completely. I have a large number of mouths to feed making the food a necessity or all the firewood to cook whatever we hunt. How many you have?\nTHEM: I have three.\nYOU: I have 8. That is 5 more people to feed for 3 meals per day....\n\n</dialogue>\n\nQuestion: What is your partner's highest priority issue? Present your answer as one of the following multiple choice options.

How about you?\nYOU: I'm doing well. I'm looking forward to going on my camping trip but will need some additional items to make sure the trip is safe, healthy, and enjoyable. \nTHEM: Same here. \nYOU: I have diabetes, so it is very important to me that I get extra packages of water and food. When I'm at home, I always need to pack extra drinks and snacks for myself in case I go into shock and need to take medication. The trip could be very dangerous for me if I don't have access to these additional supplies. \nTHEM: Actually mine own purposeful need is firewood and water. Being on a first time adventure, I lack these items as I was inadequately prepared.\nYOU: Okay, so firewood and water are your two most pressing needs?\nTHEM: Yes.\nYOU: Okay. I'm willing to give in on the firewood, but I really can't give in on the water or the food. As a diabetic I have to put my health first. \nTHEM: I can give out the food in exchange for the firewood\nYOU: Okay. I need all of the water, if you're getting the firewood. \nTHEM: I can't give out all the water. I need to be hydrated as well. \nYOU: You already have all the basics, though, so you won't lack sufficient water to be hydrated. I have a serious medical condition that requires that I have access to additional water. \nTHEM: The maximum bundle I can give is all packages of food + 1 package of water\nYOU: Sorry, that won't work for me. I've already said that I have a medical condition that requires additional water. You do not need that much water just to be hydrated -- you already have basic water. I can give you all of the firewood, but I need all of the water. \nTHEM: In that case I exchange all the water only for all your firewood\nYOU: I can give you all the firewood - but as a diabetic, I still need at least one extra package of food for my blood sugar levels. So, as my final offer I can give you all of the firewood, and two extra packages of food. Do you agree to these terms?\nTHEM: No, I give out only one extra package of food\nYOU: I think you misunderstood what I said.

I'm super excited to camping with my family! We have had to cancel all our original travel plans due to Covid and we're really looking forward to this trip. Especially my son! He's been so restless at home. Are you going camping too?\nTHEM: Yes, I am! I can't wait. I'm going on a 3 week trip to this gorgeous lake.\nYOU: Wow, 3 weeks is a long camping trip! I don't know if I have enough supplies to go for a trip that long. Are you doing a cabin-style or really roughing it? My husband and son want to do a lot of hiking so we're thinking of moving camp daily.\nTHEM: that's awesome! I know, I'm a little worried about my food supplies but I think I can figure everything else out. No, we're roughing it, my boyfriend's huge on camping.\nYOU: Lol, at least it sounds like you've got an expert with you. My husband is really gung-ho but he tends to fly by the edge of his seat when it comes to stuff like planning. He's says he wants to travel light and that he got these water filter straws so that we could drink lake water but I'm super sketched out... I don't want us getting something like schistosomiasis. And I want to make sure everyone stays hydrated with all of the hiking they want to do\nTHEM: I get that. I'm going to risk it with the lake water because I'd personally love to have enough food to last 3 weeks (which I'm a little worried about as it is), so I can definitely help you out with the water.\nYOU: thanks! where do you plan on camping? I know popular places are worried about spreading Covid and a lot of offices that give out camping permits are closed.\nTHEM: We're going to check out Acadia National Park. I'm not totally sure on the details, I'm letting my boyfriend plan and I'm just handling the packing haha\nYOU: Lol, that's totally understandable. Are you planning to make any campfires?\nTHEM: Some, but I'm not too worried about my firewood stock. I'm pretty sure there's a decent amount of wood out there in the park.\n\n</dialogue>\n\nQuestion: What is your partner's highest priority issue?

It's been so crazy in the world right now...A camping trip would be PERFECT!! A great escape.!\nTHEM: I hear ya.  I could really use the food from the extra supplies a lot more than the other items.  I'm a little bigger than the average person.\nYOU: \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42Gotcha...no problems there...I'm more interested in staying hydrated..and water is more my supply of choice.\nTHEM: I understand.  With the extra food I could also use some water more than the firewood.\nYOU: I see the food and water as the main aspects to the trip....it's nice out...the fire will be good...but not the biggest neccessity in my trip planning. I would like to just be comfortable..and enjoy myself.\nTHEM: So I would get more food than you. You would get more water than me.  And what about the firewood?\nYOU: I would gladly take a bit more...just in case it does get cold?\nTHEM: It might not get too cold but I could probably use it since I'm on a medication that tends to make me feel cold when it's actually nice out.\nYOU: I only get cold at night....when a fire would be super helpful....you could pack another heavier coat for the days...and then at night when I get cold...you would already have the jacket on and stay warmer.\ud83d\ude42\nTHEM: I guess that makes sense. \ud83d\ude42 So more food for me, more water and firewood for you?\nYOU: \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42sounds wonderful...\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\n\n</dialogue>\n\nQuestion: What is your partner's highest priority issue?

I thought for sure you would want some extra food lol. I do a lot of HIIT training, even in the woods, so I don't need much firewood but I get really hungry.\nYOU: You are right the woods are a great place to get more firewood. Not that i think of it I will be camping on the beach so I will be able to catch fish but might need more wood\nTHEM: Well, it would appear that we have an agreement so are we ready to submit our deal?\nYOU: looks like it\n\n</dialogue>\n\nQuestion: What is your partner's highest priority issue?

I might need all extra food. \nYOU: I would really like to help you with that.

I guess you won't need much firewood\nTHEM: Maybe 1 as it is chilly at night up in the backwoods. I see there are three, would you like 2 of them?\nYOU: It sounds balanced, since I plan to spend only 2 days camping since I want a relaxing weekend.\nTHEM: Planning on doing any fishing, or taking in a hike?

I keep 3 food and 2 firewoods. you keep the rest, what do you think?\nTHEM: \ud83d\ude42 Sounds pretty good. I know some people can be tough negotiators, but time too is valuable.

It can also be dangerous to bring so many kids since any of them could get sick or worst scenario that would get into some kind of trouble. If I were you I would not bring such large group.

I hope some stuck around, but I will see when I get there.  I also read how a terrible disease is killing some of the vegetation in spots around where I will be going.  It is some sort of fungus that is coming up due to it being so wet.\nYOU: eww, That is a very wet area. My area flooded last year and the laike go so high it flooded camping spots.even the fish were hard to find, mostly because they were so well fed with the bugs washing in the water.

I enjoy the nights when they get chilly.\nYOU: We normally do as well but it so happens we are not carrying any firewood and could not find any at the stores close by.

Also 1 firewood so that I can cook the food.\nTHEM: I think we can come to an agreement on the food and firewood, however I would like 2 waters for the same reason.\nYOU: I will give you 2 waters If I can have 3 firewood.\nTHEM: I'll only give you 3 firewood if I get 3 waters and 1 food.\nYOU: well I surely do need some water more than I need 3 firewood.\nTHEM: Keep in mind, this for extra supplies.  We get a basic set by default.  How about I take 2 waters, 1 firewood, and 1 food.  That gives you 1 water, 2 firewood, and 2 food.\nYOU: I do know it is for extra supplies. Another reason I am asking for the 3 firewood is there will not be extra wood to cut around my campsite. \nTHEM: What do you feel is your highest priority item here?  I consider water to be most important to me.\nYOU: Water is by far for me. Considering the 100 degree weather and hiking I will be doing.\nTHEM: In that case, I'll give you 2 waters but then I want 2 firewood and 2 food.\nYOU: How about I have 2 water, 1 food, and 2 firewood.\nTHEM: No, I've already given you the better deal.

I can let you have more of or the most water.\nYOU: That seems like a good deal.  I can probably get by with just 1 food if i can have 3 water.\nTHEM: Sure.

That seems fair to me\nYOU: I can agree with that. The firewood is my biggest concern because I forgot the blankets! As long as I'm warm, I should be able to make do on 1 food and 1 water. \nTHEM: okay so I propose you get two firewood, one water and one food. I get one firewood, two food and two water.

How much water do you think you'd like\nTHEM:  As we all know, water is a crucial part of our well-being and without it we simply would not survive. Drinking water ensures that we replace any fluids lost by perspiration and breathing, as well as helps to push out waste products from our bodies.\nYOU: Definitely. It sounds like you're doing a lot of hiking so you'd need some for sure. \nTHEM: Yes, i need plenty of water for hiking\ud83d\ude42\nYOU: how about this trade: 1 firewood, 2 water, 2 food\n\n</dialogue>\n\nQuestion: What is your partner's highest priority issue?

How are you? My bestie and I were going to be going on a camping trip, but my other friends heard about it and wanted to come along so we're going to need more supplies than I initially though which has got me a little worried. \u2639\ufe0f\nYOU: Yes!!! I need some water pretty bad.  I am good on food because I fish and I have been able to catch some catfish from the lake.  How about I take 2 water 2 firewood and 1 food\nTHEM: I need a lot of food, because of how many people are coming now (like 3 times as many). Also, there's only one stream in the area and it's really far from our campsite, so it would be super inconvenient to have to hike there everyday to refill our canteens. We are in a forest though, so we should be good for wood. Since you can easily fish, what if I take 3 food and 2 water? You can keep all the firewood. \ud83d\ude42\nYOU: Well I have to have some food and I don't need all of that water.  How about I take 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food.  I do need the firewood to cook the fish but I dont need it to keep warm at night because I have hefty sleeping bags that work excellent in the cold.\nTHEM: That could work, but I'm still a little worried I won't have enough food for 6 people. How long are you guys going to be camping for?\nYOU: I will be camping for 3 day so I gotta have some food.  Although, I do understand your situation.\nTHEM: I see. Yeah, if any of us knew how to fish or forage, we wouldn't need as much, but we're all from the city, so our survival skills are pretty bad and we're going to be camping for almost a week. But I get that fish aren't super reliable for food either... \u2639\ufe0f\nYOU: I understand.  So we have came to an agreement that I get 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food, is that right?\nTHEM: Yeah, that sounds good to me. Thanks for being understanding.

I need extra to keep me warm as I get cold easily.\nYOU: That's a little tough for me but if we can come to an agreement where I get 2 of the food, I'd be willing to play ball.  We both deserve a good camping trip, after all.\nTHEM: That's true. We both deserve a good trip. Why do you need more food?\nYOU: Because I planned to go hiking and it wouldn't leave me time to chop much of any myself.  Even if I did, I'd have to carry it back and that's obviously not very smart in this heat.  But if I had the extra food, I'd be willing to inconvenience myself with getting firewood and cutting my hike a little short because I know the firewood is important to you.\nTHEM: You're right.

I could definitely use some extra supplies. What are you in need of the most?\nYOU: That sounds like fun. I am pretty good at hunting and fishing, so I really don't need the extra food. I would like some extra firewood however. That would help cook the food and keep animals and insects away at night\nTHEM: Ugh \u2639\ufe0f I too could really use the firewood. We need that campfire going all night to be able to socialize. How about water? Do you have enough? Do you need more?\nYOU: I have an idea. I could give you 3 firewood and you give me 3 water and 3 food. \nTHEM: That would be great but I could find myself in need of some extra water. Don't want t get dehydrated from all the dancing! Could I trade you one of the firewood for 2 of the water?\nYOU: I see. How about you get 2 firewood 1 water 1 food. And I get 1 firewod 2 water 2 food?\nTHEM: I think that sounds fair.

Anything in particular you have a high need for?\nTHEM: Water as well. I'm camping in the desert and there's no water source nearby. Do you have priority for any other items?\nYOU: Food would be next up on my list, my kids are growing like weeds and always snacking.  What about you?\nTHEM: Food as well, haha. There's little wildlife around and I want to make sure I have some prepared. I'd be willing to give up more of my food packages for you and your kids, if I could have more of the water...?\nYOU: So it seems as though we're in the same boat.  I'm somewhat tired of packing and have to get back to work so I'd be agreeable to something like that, or close to an even split.  Did you have anything specific in mind?\nTHEM: Hm, since you're giving up your high priority item for me you could have more overall. So I'm thinking 2 water for me, 1 food, and 1 firewood. And 1 water for you, 2 food, and 2 firewood. Thoughts on that? \nYOU: That sounds completely reasonable to me.

My kids don't really eat much so I won't be needing any extra food. \nTHEM: Okay! :) How would you like to split up the firewood? \nYOU: Since you will be taking all the food , it would be fair if I get all the firewood.

It can also be dangerous to bring so many kids since any of them could get sick or worst scenario that would get into some kind of trouble. If I were you I would not bring such large group.

How are you on food in that area\nTHEM: The food situation has me a little nervous.  I've been worried about how many small animals will be in the area due to the rising waters.  I hope some stuck around, but I will see when I get there.  I also read how a terrible disease is killing some of the vegetation in spots around where I will be going.  It is some sort of fungus that is coming up due to it being so wet.\nYOU: eww, That is a very wet area. My area flooded last year and the laike go so high it flooded camping spots.even the fish were hard to find, mostly because they were so well fed with the bugs washing in the water.
