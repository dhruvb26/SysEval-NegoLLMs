My bestie and I were going to be going on a camping trip, but my other friends heard about it and wanted to come along so we're going to need more supplies than I initially though which has got me a little worried. \u2639\ufe0f\nYOU: Yes!!! I need some water pretty bad.  I am good on food because I fish and I have been able to catch some catfish from the lake.  How about I take 2 water 2 firewood and 1 food\nTHEM: I need a lot of food, because of how many people are coming now (like 3 times as many). Also, there's only one stream in the area and it's really far from our campsite, so it would be super inconvenient to have to hike there everyday to refill our canteens. We are in a forest though, so we should be good for wood. Since you can easily fish, what if I take 3 food and 2 water? You can keep all the firewood. \ud83d\ude42\nYOU: Well I have to have some food and I don't need all of that water.  How about I take 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food.  I do need the firewood to cook the fish but I dont need it to keep warm at night because I have hefty sleeping bags that work excellent in the cold.\nTHEM: That could work, but I'm still a little worried I won't have enough food for 6 people. How long are you guys going to be camping for?\nYOU: I will be camping for 3 day so I gotta have some food.  Although, I do understand your situation.\nTHEM: I see. Yeah, if any of us knew how to fish or forage, we wouldn't need as much, but we're all from the city, so our survival skills are pretty bad and we're going to be camping for almost a week.

Hoping it'll be good, and yours as well.  I was hoping we could negotiate so I could get this extra water - I was planning on this being a hiking trip and it's pretty warm and humid out, so I imagine I'll need it.\nTHEM: I don't have any problems letting you have all 3 waters. Would you be willing to give me all 3 firewood? I need extra to keep me warm as I get cold easily.\nYOU: That's a little tough for me but if we can come to an agreement where I get 2 of the food, I'd be willing to play ball.  We both deserve a good camping trip, after all.\nTHEM: That's true. We both deserve a good trip. Why do you need more food?\nYOU: Because I planned to go hiking and it wouldn't leave me time to chop much of any myself.  Even if I did, I'd have to carry it back and that's obviously not very smart in this heat.  But if I had the extra food, I'd be willing to inconvenience myself with getting firewood and cutting my hike a little short because I know the firewood is important to you.\nTHEM: You're right. I do not plan on hiking so you need more food than me. If I am correct, would I get 3 firewood/1 food while you get 3 water/2 food?\nYOU: That's what I could live with, yes.\nTHEM: We should be able to trade soon.

I do. I love hiking and running trails!  Due to the extreme dry weather I should have plenty of wood I can scavenge for if you need all of it!\nYOU: Hmm.

Hoping it'll be good, and yours as well.  I was hoping we could negotiate so I could get this extra water - I was planning on this being a hiking trip and it's pretty warm and humid out, so I imagine I'll need it.\nTHEM: I don't have any problems letting you have all 3 waters. Would you be willing to give me all 3 firewood? I need extra to keep me warm as I get cold easily.\nYOU: That's a little tough for me but if we can come to an agreement where I get 2 of the food, I'd be willing to play ball.  We both deserve a good camping trip, after all.\nTHEM: That's true. We both deserve a good trip. Why do you need more food?\nYOU: Because I planned to go hiking and it wouldn't leave me time to chop much of any myself.  Even if I did, I'd have to carry it back and that's obviously not very smart in this heat.  But if I had the extra food, I'd be willing to inconvenience myself with getting firewood and cutting my hike a little short because I know the firewood is important to you.\nTHEM: You're right. I do not plan on hiking so you need more food than me. If I am correct, would I get 3 firewood/1 food while you get 3 water/2 food?\nYOU: That's what I could live with, yes.\nTHEM: We should be able to trade soon. I hope you have a great trip!\nYOU: You too!  Great birdwatching this season.\n\n</dialogue>\n\nQuestion: What is your highest priority issue?

I saw just how connected I was to technology and everything else!\nYOU: I'm up here to do some cross training and noticed that there is some extra water around. Even though the nights are cold I could use some extra water. Do you exercise much?\nTHEM: It has been extremely dry in the area I will be going to so I was hoping to get a little extra water too.  I do. I love hiking and running trails!  Due to the extreme dry weather I should have plenty of wood I can scavenge for if you need all of it!\nYOU: Hmm. Maybe we could go out together on a run. \ud83d\ude42Always nice to have a running partner. So maybe on the water you get 2, me 1. Then on the Firewood the opposite?\nTHEM: That would be fun! I feel like I always do better when I have someone to run against.  Competition does me good. That sounds fantastic on the fire wood and water split.

Hope you too are looking forward to this much needed camping trip. What are your needs in terms of extra packages?\nTHEM: Since this is the first time for the family to be camping, having plenty of food for everyone is on the top of my list.\nYOU: I am fine with you having the 3 foods. Is it okay if I have 3 water units We are fasting and need lots of hydration.\nTHEM: Are you sure you need all of the water? It would be nice to have some extra.\nYOU: Well, we do need the water pretty badly. But I guess wanting all the water is stingy so I will pack extra water since we are not packing food. How about you guys receive 1 water and 3 food units?\nTHEM: If you feel you absolutely need the 3 waters, I will let you have them provided I can have 2 firewoods along with the 3 foods.\nYOU: That is so nice of you. Being that you have family, you might need more firewood for cooking for the crew! Do you agree? And how many kids are you traveling with? \nTHEM: I have 2 kids and want to make sure they stay warm.  The firewood will go a long way in keeping them comfortable.\nYOU: I am leaving my little ones home. I feel a little guilty but am going forward with the plan! So, I input our order that you guys receive 3 food, 2 firewood, and no water. Are we in agreement?\nTHEM: Yes. That sounds fair to me.\n\n</dialogue>\n\nQuestion: What is your highest priority issue?
